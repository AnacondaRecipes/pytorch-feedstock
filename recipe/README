# Package overview

Pytorch is configurable via a variety of environment variables, many of
which are documented in the header of their setup.py. For example, the
acceleration backend can be provided by CUDA, MKL, or OpenBLAS.

Build.sh and bld.bat in this package mostly deal with setting the
environment variables that we want to set, before calling setup.py, which
is the entry point to the Pytorch build system.


# GPU building

To build with GPU support, uncomment/comment the lines in conda_build_config.yaml as documented there. Currently, these
builds need to be done manually on a machine with the linux drivers installed, as the CI system does not support them.

# Tests

Note that the PyTorch test suite is run, but there is no indication of test results, or even if the test suite has
fallen over completely, without looking at the logs. It is very important to validate the package by looking at the test
results before release. A statistically small number of test failures is generally ok, for example because of floating
point hardware implementation differences on different architectures.

# Handling long builds

The builds are very long, but there are some measures you can take to reduce them during development.

1. Only build one python variant. Currently the most supported variant is python 3.11; python 3.12 isn't supported for
   some features.
2. Use ccache. Note that ccache will result in cache misses if the build folder is different, which is the case by
   default if conda-build is called twice. To get around this, build in a previous folder (conda build --dirty <previous_root_folder_name>)
   or export CCACHE_BASEDIR=${PREFIX}/../  to strip the root folder (untested, needs to be there before the first run).
3. (For CUDA) only build the compute capability of the build/test machine. (TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST)

# Further work

## Unvendoring

Caffe2 could be conda-packaged, and this could then be unvendored.
Fmt and zstd are dependencies of caffe2, and although these are conda
packages, they haven't been separated from caffe2 in pytorch's build
system, because the halfway-solution seemed error-prone and not worth
the effort (the ideal way being to package and unvendor caffe2).
