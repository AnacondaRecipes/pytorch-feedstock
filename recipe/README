To build a conda pytorch package with GPU support

* Build the required Docker containers:

    Dockerfiles can be found at: https://github.com/jjhelmus/docker-images

    CUDA 9.0: pkg_build_cos6_cuda90
    CUDA 9.2: pkg_build_cos6_cuda92
    CUDA 10.0: pkg_build_cos6_cuda100

* Start the docker container using:

    ```
    sudo nvidia-docker run -v `pwd`:/io -it pkg_build_cos6_cuda90
    ```

* Update conda and conda-build, and navigate to the recipe root folder.

    Modify conda_build_config.yaml in this directory to specify the
    CUDA, CuDNN, and python versions.

    To start a build use:

    ```
    conda build .
    ```
# Further unvendoring
Caffe2 could be conda-packaged, and this could then be unvendored.
Fmt and zstd are dependencies of caffe2, and although these are conda
packages, they haven't been separated from caffe2 in pytorch's build
system, because the halfway-solution seemed error-prone and not worth
the effort (the ideal way being to package and unvendor caffe2).
