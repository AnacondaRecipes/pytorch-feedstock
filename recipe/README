# Package overview

Pytorch is configurable via a variety of environment variables, many of
which are documented in the header of their setup.py. For example, the
acceleration backend can be provided by CUDA, MKL, or OpenBLAS.

Build.sh and bld.bat in this package mostly deal with setting the
environment variables that we want to set, before calling setup.py, which
is the entry point to the Pytorch build system.


# GPU building

To build with GPU support, uncomment/comment the lines in conda_build_config.yaml as documented there. Currently, these
builds need to be done manually on a machine with cudatoolkit installed, as the CI system does not support them.


# Further work

## Unvendoring

Caffe2 could be conda-packaged, and this could then be unvendored.
Fmt and zstd are dependencies of caffe2, and although these are conda
packages, they haven't been separated from caffe2 in pytorch's build
system, because the halfway-solution seemed error-prone and not worth
the effort (the ideal way being to package and unvendor caffe2).
