# We currently haven't implemented and tested GPU acceleration on OSX (although it's possible for osx-arm64).
# This is also the case for linux powerPC and ARM cores.
# We also don't support it on Windows, because we need magma as a dependency and on windows, CMake isnâ€™t playing ball
# with building it with CUDA support.
# So, only linux-64 for now.
