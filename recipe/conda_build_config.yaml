################# For GPU building, uncomment everything below and comment out the two lines above this #############
## We currently haven't implemented and tested GPU acceleration on OSX (although it's possible for osx-arm64).
## This is also the case for linux powerPC and ARM cores.
## We also don't support it on Windows, because we need magma as a dependency and on windows, CMake isnâ€™t playing ball
## with building it with CUDA support.
## So, only linux-64 for now.
## Additionally, we need to pin the compiler if we're building with CUDA support (but not otherwise), see here:
