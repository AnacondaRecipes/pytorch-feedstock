# If we don't pin the compiler on windows, we get compiler syntax errors. This could be because conda-build pulls in a
# different runtime version from the compiler version, for some reason. Upstream uses 2019 on their CI, and it's our

# We currently support GPUs on linux-64 (with a CUDA backend) and osx-arm64 (with an MPS backend)
# We don't support it on Windows, because we need magma as a dependency and there have been significant issues getting
# CMake to build magma with CUDA support.
# For linux-64, we need to pin the compiler if we're building with CUDA support (but not otherwise), see here:
