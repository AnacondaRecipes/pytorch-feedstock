# If we don't pin the compiler on windows, we get compiler syntax errors. This could be because conda-build pulls in a
# different runtime version from the compiler version, for some reason. Upstream uses 2019 on their CI, and it's our
# most recent, so let's use that.

# This could be done using extend_keys instead, with a change to the base cbc.yaml.
