  summary: PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.
  description: |
    PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
      - Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
      - Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system
    You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.
